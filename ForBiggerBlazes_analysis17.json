The tagline 'For Bigger Blazes' is displayed, highlighting a visual spectacle on the big screen. The ad concludes by showing the Google Chromecast device being plugged into the TV and promotes accessibility of HBO Go on TV.",
  "description": "The video opens with a top-down shot of a tablet displaying a scene from Game of Thrones, placed on a wooden table next to a cup of coffee. The user then taps the tablet and the screen transitions to a TV displaying the same scene, but much larger. A hand plugs the Chromecast device into the back of the TV. The video's mood is exciting and it aims to showcase the seamless transition from mobile to big-screen viewing with Chromecast.",
